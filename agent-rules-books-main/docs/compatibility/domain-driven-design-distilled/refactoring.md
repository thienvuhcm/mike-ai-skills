# Domain-Driven Design Distilled vs Refactoring

Status: reviewed
Research basis: mini-only

Verdict: ✅ Complementary

Conflict: 12%
Overlap: 38%
Complementarity: 78%

## Loading Decision

Use together when changing existing code: one rule set controls safe change sequencing while the other defines the target design, construction, architecture, data, or production quality.

## Book A Pressure

- Domain-Driven Design Distilled should drive tasks where selective DDD, subdomain importance, Bounded Contexts, local language, and justified tactical patterns dominate.
- Evidence: `domain-driven-design-distilled/domain-driven-design-distilled.mini.md` lines 3-5: applies when business software has domain complexity, language ambiguity, strategic differentiation, or integration risk but needs smallest effective DDD rather than ceremony.

## Book B Pressure

- Refactoring should drive tasks where behavior-preserving structural change and current-smell scope control dominate.
- Evidence: `refactoring/refactoring.mini.md` lines 3-5: applies when changing existing code, preparing a feature/bug fix, reviewing cleanup, or reducing structural friction without changing observable behavior.

## Complementary Forces

- Claim: Domain-Driven Design Distilled contributes selective-DDD, subdomain, Bounded-Context, local-language, and justified-pattern pressure; Refactoring contributes behavior-preserving, small-step, test-backed refactoring pressure. Together they are useful only where both scopes are active.
- Evidence:
  - `domain-driven-design-distilled/domain-driven-design-distilled.mini.md` lines 13-30: requires capability/subdomain/context/language first, Core Domain investment, selective DDD, explicit Bounded Context ownership, term translation, deliberate context relationships, integration style by coupling/failure semantics, separate integration contracts, local domain terms, justified Entities/Value Objects/Aggregates/Domain Events/Application Services, infrastructure-free domain model, code that teaches the model, timeboxed modeling aids, and planning from modeling uncertainty.
  - `refactoring/refactoring.mini.md` lines 13-26: requires observable behavior preservation, small reversible steps, safety nets, preparatory/follow-up refactoring around feature work, current-smell focus, simplest named moves, intent-revealing names/functions, behavior and state with owners, explicit data/mutation/contracts, honest conditional simplification, evidence-based abstraction, preserved error semantics, reviewable patch intent, and stop conditions.

## Overlap

- Claim: They overlap where both affect safe existing-code change, tests, behavior preservation, ownership, and stopping before speculative cleanup; the overlap score reflects how often an agent would receive similar pressure from both.
- Evidence:
  - `domain-driven-design-distilled/domain-driven-design-distilled.mini.md` lines 48-56: checks subdomain investment, explicit context relationship, visible Ubiquitous Language, tested translations, justified tactical patterns, small Aggregates, coordinating application services, infrastructure-free domain model, and captured modeling discoveries.
  - `refactoring/refactoring.mini.md` lines 43-49: checks behavior preservation, separated structural/behavior/test updates, safety net, real friction removed, clearer ownership/control/data/interfaces, reviewable runnable patch, and stopped cleanup.

## Conflicts

- Claim: The tension is scope creep: design or architecture improvements must not override behavior preservation, characterization, or the current-smell stop condition.
- Evidence:
  - `domain-driven-design-distilled/domain-driven-design-distilled.mini.md` lines 7-9: corrects starting from tactical patterns, frameworks, persistence, APIs, or class shapes before business capability, subdomain, context, and language.
  - `refactoring/refactoring.mini.md` lines 7-9: corrects cleanup turning into rewrite, hidden feature change, or speculative architecture.

## Use Together When

- Use together when existing code must be reshaped toward Domain-Driven Design Distilled goals without changing observable behavior or turning cleanup into redesign.

## Prefer One When

- Prefer the refactoring rule set when observable behavior must stay unchanged; prefer the other book when designing new behavior rather than reshaping existing structure.
