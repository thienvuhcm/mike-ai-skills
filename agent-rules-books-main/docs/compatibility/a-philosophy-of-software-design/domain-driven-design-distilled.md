# A Philosophy of Software Design vs Domain-Driven Design Distilled

Status: reviewed
Research basis: mini-only

Verdict: ✅ Complementary

Conflict: 14%
Overlap: 38%
Complementarity: 74%

## Loading Decision

Use together when domain language, invariants, lifecycle, or Bounded Contexts affect the task and the other rule set governs implementation quality, reliability, data, or safe change.

## Book A Pressure

- A Philosophy of Software Design should drive tasks that need module-depth, API-shape, information-hiding, and complexity-reduction judgment.
- Evidence: `a-philosophy-of-software-design/a-philosophy-of-software-design.mini.md` lines 3-5: applies to module design, API changes, decomposition, refactoring, naming, comments, tests, performance work, and changes where complexity spreads.

## Book B Pressure

- Domain-Driven Design Distilled should drive tasks where selective DDD, subdomain importance, Bounded Contexts, local language, and justified tactical patterns dominate.
- Evidence: `domain-driven-design-distilled/domain-driven-design-distilled.mini.md` lines 3-5: applies when business software has domain complexity, language ambiguity, strategic differentiation, or integration risk but needs smallest effective DDD rather than ceremony.

## Complementary Forces

- Claim: A Philosophy of Software Design contributes module-depth, API-shape, information-hiding, and complexity-reduction pressure; Domain-Driven Design Distilled contributes selective-DDD, subdomain, Bounded-Context, local-language, and justified-pattern pressure. Together they are useful only where both scopes are active.
- Evidence:
  - `a-philosophy-of-software-design/a-philosophy-of-software-design.mini.md` lines 13-20: makes reduced complexity, deep modules, caller-oriented interfaces, hidden volatile details, downward-pulled complexity, right-sized generality, and complexity-based split/merge decisions central.
  - `domain-driven-design-distilled/domain-driven-design-distilled.mini.md` lines 13-30: requires capability/subdomain/context/language first, Core Domain investment, selective DDD, explicit Bounded Context ownership, term translation, deliberate context relationships, integration style by coupling/failure semantics, separate integration contracts, local domain terms, justified Entities/Value Objects/Aggregates/Domain Events/Application Services, infrastructure-free domain model, code that teaches the model, timeboxed modeling aids, and planning from modeling uncertainty.

## Overlap

- Claim: They overlap where both affect boundaries, explicit responsibilities, tests, coupling reduction, and avoiding hidden assumptions; the overlap score reflects how often an agent would receive similar pressure from both.
- Evidence:
  - `a-philosophy-of-software-design/a-philosophy-of-software-design.mini.md` lines 42-46: finishes by checking understanding effort, interface value, localized decisions, protected internals, and non-duplicative names/comments.
  - `domain-driven-design-distilled/domain-driven-design-distilled.mini.md` lines 48-56: checks subdomain investment, explicit context relationship, visible Ubiquitous Language, tested translations, justified tactical patterns, small Aggregates, coordinating application services, infrastructure-free domain model, and captured modeling discoveries.

## Conflicts

- Claim: The tension is DDD ceremony: tactical patterns must protect model meaning and should not displace the other rule set's simpler construction, refactoring, data, or operational constraints.
- Evidence:
  - `a-philosophy-of-software-design/a-philosophy-of-software-design.mini.md` lines 7-10: corrects the false belief that small pieces, wrappers, patterns, or documentation are simple when they increase cognitive load.
  - `domain-driven-design-distilled/domain-driven-design-distilled.mini.md` lines 13-30: requires capability/subdomain/context/language first, Core Domain investment, selective DDD, explicit Bounded Context ownership, term translation, deliberate context relationships, integration style by coupling/failure semantics, separate integration contracts, local domain terms, justified Entities/Value Objects/Aggregates/Domain Events/Application Services, infrastructure-free domain model, code that teaches the model, timeboxed modeling aids, and planning from modeling uncertainty.

## Use Together When

- Use together when one change simultaneously involves module/API depth, information hiding, and complexity reduction and selective DDD, subdomain importance, local language, and justified tactical patterns; otherwise load only the rule set whose trigger is actually present.

## Prefer One When

- Prefer the DDD rule set when language, lifecycle, invariants, or context boundaries drive design; prefer the other book for tasks without visible domain-model pressure.
