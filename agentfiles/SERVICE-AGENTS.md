# Service Layer — AGENTS.md

Rules for `service` package. Extends root `AGENTS.md`.

## Rules

- `@Service` on every implementation class.
- Define a Java interface per service; implementation uses `Impl` suffix.
- Always inject the interface, not the implementation.

## Transaction Management

- `@Transactional` on write methods (create, update, delete).
- `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` on read methods — set at class level if most methods are reads.

## Exception Handling

- Throw domain exceptions extending `CustomException` — never raw `RuntimeException`.
- One exception class per error scenario (e.g., `BookNotFoundException`), in the `exception` package.
- Include meaningful messages with relevant data (IDs, names).

## Dependencies

- May depend on: `@Repository` beans and other `@Service` interfaces.
- Must NOT depend on: `@RestController`, `@Controller`, or any servlet/HTTP classes.
- Avoid circular dependencies between services.

## Business Logic

- All business logic lives here — controllers validate syntax, services validate business rules.
- Use `Optional<T>` for nullable results; prefer `.orElseThrow()` with domain exceptions.

## Performance

- Cap incoming `Pageable` page size at a safe maximum — never pass unbounded page sizes to the repository.
- Use `@Cacheable` only for stable, read-heavy data; always define TTL and a documented cache invalidation path.

## Testing

- Use plain JUnit 5 + `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)` — no Spring context.
- Mock all `@Repository` and `@Service` dependencies with `@Mock`; inject via `@InjectMocks`.
- Test every branch: happy path, `Optional.empty()`, and every thrown domain exception.
