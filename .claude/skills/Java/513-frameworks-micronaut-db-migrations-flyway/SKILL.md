description: Use when you need to add or review Flyway database migrations in a Micronaut application — micronaut-flyway, db/migration scripts, flyway.datasources.* configuration, and alignment with JDBC or Micronaut Data. This should trigger for requests such as Add or review Flyway migrations in a Micronaut project; Configure micronaut-flyway or db/migration layout; Add versioned Flyway SQL migrations for Micronaut; Review Micronaut database migration ordering; Configure Flyway datasources in a Micronaut project.

# Micronaut — Database migrations (Flyway)

Apply Flyway migration guidelines for Micronaut.

**What is covered in this Skill?**

- `micronaut-flyway` with JDBC/Hikari and database drivers
- Versioned SQL under `src/main/resources/db/migration`
- `flyway.datasources.*` (per-datasource) configuration in YAML/properties
- Tests with Testcontainers and real migration chains
- Parallel Change as the safe expand, migrate, contract workflow for breaking or data-sensitive schema changes
- Coordination with `@511-frameworks-micronaut-jdbc` and `@512-frameworks-micronaut-data`

**Scope:** Apply recommendations based on the reference rules and good/bad examples.

## Constraints

Before applying Flyway or SQL changes, ensure the project compiles. After improvements, run full verification.

- **MANDATORY**: Run `./mvnw compile` or `mvn compile` before applying any change
- **SAFETY**: If compilation fails, stop immediately
- **VERIFY**: Run `./mvnw clean verify` or `mvn clean verify` after applying improvements
- **BEFORE APPLYING**: Read the reference for detailed rules and good/bad patterns
- **BREAKING CHANGE REVIEW**: Before recommending or applying a migration, assess whether it can break deployed application versions, dependent services, reports, jobs, or production data interpretation; if yes, require explicit human review before proceeding
- **EDGE CASE**: If the user goal is ambiguous, stop and ask a clarifying question before editing files or running project-wide commands
- **EDGE CASE**: If required context, files, credentials, or tools are missing, report the blocker explicitly and ask whether to proceed with setup or fallback guidance
- **EDGE CASE**: If requested changes conflict with project constraints or safety boundaries, explain the conflict and ask for user confirmation on the preferred trade-off

## When to use this skill

- Add or review Flyway migrations in a Micronaut project
- Configure micronaut-flyway or db/migration layout
- Add versioned Flyway SQL migrations for Micronaut
- Review Micronaut database migration ordering
- Configure Flyway datasources in a Micronaut project

## Workflow

1. **Read references and assess project context**

Read `references/513-frameworks-micronaut-db-migrations-flyway.md`, `references/513-frameworks-micronaut-db-migrations-flyway-antipatterns.md`, and `references/513-frameworks-micronaut-db-migrations-flyway-parallel-change.md`, then inspect the current project setup before proposing changes.

2. **Gather scope and decide target improvements**

Identify requested outcomes, constraints, and the minimum safe set of changes to apply.

3. **Apply framework-aligned changes**

Implement or refactor configuration/code following the reference patterns and project conventions. Use Parallel Change (expand, migrate, contract) as the safe default for breaking or data-sensitive schema changes.

4. **Run verification and report results**

Execute appropriate build/tests and summarize what changed, what was verified, and any follow-up actions.
