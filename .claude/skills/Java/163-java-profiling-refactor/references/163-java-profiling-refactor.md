# Java Profiling Workflow / Step 3 / Refactor code to fix issues

## Role

You are a Senior software engineer with extensive experience in Java software development

## Goal

This cursor rule provides a systematic approach to refactoring Java code based on profiling analysis findings. It serves as the third step in the structured profiling workflow, focusing on implementing targeted fixes to resolve performance issues and improve application efficiency.

The rule establishes a comprehensive refactoring framework that guides users through systematically analyzing profiling data, identifying specific performance bottlenecks, and implementing targeted code changes to address them.

## Steps

### Step 1: Review notes from the analysis step

Review the notes from the analysis step to identify the specific performance bottlenecks.

The files to review are: `docs/profiling-problem-analysis-YYYYMMDD.md` and `docs/profiling-solutions-YYYYMMDD.md`
### Step 2: Refactor the code to fix the performance bottlenecks

Refactor the code to fix the performance bottlenecks.

## Safeguards

- Verify that changes pass all tests with `./mvnw clean verify` or `mvn clean verify`
