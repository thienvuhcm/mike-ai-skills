# Embedded commands installer

Install a predefined set of embedded project commands from repository assets into a user-selected target directory. This is an interactive skill.

**What is covered in this Skill?**

- Interactive target selection (`.github/commands`, `.claude/commands`, `.cursor/command`, or `.codex/commands`)
- Deterministic copy of all embedded commands defined via XInclude from `assets/commands`
- Idempotent re-installation with clear overwrite reporting
- Support for four command framework destinations

## Constraints

This skill installs only the embedded project commands bundle and must ask for destination before writing files.

- **MUST** ask the user to choose one of four command destinations before installing
- **MUST** copy all embedded command files defined in `references/004-commands-installation.md`
- **MUST** preserve file names from the reference content and report overwrite actions
- **MUST** create the destination directory if it does not exist

## When to use this skill

- Install embedded commands
- Bootstrap .cursor/command from project assets
- Bootstrap .claude/commands from embedded commands
- Copy project commands into .codex/commands
- Install command suite into .github/commands
