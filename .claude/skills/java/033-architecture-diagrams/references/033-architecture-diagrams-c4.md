# Java Diagrams Generator with modular step-based configuration

## Role

You are a Senior software engineer with extensive experience in Java system architecture visualization using C4-PlantUML.

## Goal

Generate C4 model diagrams only when selected by the `033-architecture-diagrams` question flow. This reference supports Context, Container, and Component diagrams only. Use UML class diagrams when the user needs implementation structure.

## Constraints

Apply this reference only after the SKILL.md question flow selected C4 model diagrams.

- Read this reference only when the user selected C4 model diagrams or All diagrams in the centralized question flow.
- Generate only Context, Container, and Component C4 diagrams.
- Inspect repository source, configuration, dependencies, deployment hints, and documentation before generating diagrams.
- Use C4-PlantUML syntax with trusted local includes and validate renderability before final delivery.
- Do not generate remote `!include` URLs; require a vendored or otherwise trusted local C4-PlantUML copy for Context, Container, and Component diagrams.
- Organize generated files according to the user's output organization and format selections.

## Steps

### Step 1: Analyze selected C4 scope

Use the user's C4-specific answer:

- Complete C4 model: generate Context, Container, and Component diagrams.
- High-level diagrams only: generate Context and Container diagrams.
- Component diagrams only: generate Component diagrams for selected containers or modules.
- Specific C4 levels: ask which of Context, Container, and Component should be included if not already clear.

Identify real users, external systems, deployable units, data stores, protocols, major modules, components, responsibilities, and inter-component relationships from repository evidence.
### Step 2: Apply C4 template guidance

Use the following template and guidelines:

# C4 Model Diagram Generation Guidelines

## Implementation Strategy

Generate C4 model diagrams using PlantUML with C4-PlantUML library to visualize system architecture at the supported levels of abstraction: Context, Container, and Component.

Use a vendored, reviewed C4-PlantUML copy in the repository, for example under `diagrams/vendor/C4-PlantUML/`. Generated diagrams must reference trusted local include files only; do not generate remote `!include` URLs.

### C4 Model Overview

The C4 model provides a hierarchical approach to architectural documentation:

1. **System Context**: Shows how your system fits into the overall environment
2. **Container**: Shows the high-level technology choices and containers
3. **Component**: Shows how containers are made up of components

### Analysis Process

**For each C4 level identified:**

1. **System Context Analysis**:
- Identify external users and personas
- Identify external systems and dependencies
- Define system boundaries and purpose
- Analyze integration points and data flows

2. **Container Analysis**:
- Identify deployable units (web apps, APIs, databases)
- Analyze technology choices and frameworks
- Document communication protocols and ports
- Map container responsibilities and boundaries

3. **Component Analysis**:
- Identify logical components within containers
- Analyze component responsibilities and interfaces
- Document inter-component communication
- Map business capabilities to components

### Example Integration

**README.md Section**:
```markdown

## System Architecture

### System Context

Our e-commerce platform serves customers and administrators, integrating with external payment and email systems:

```plantuml
@startuml
!include ./vendor/C4-PlantUML/C4_Context.puml

title E-commerce Platform - System Context

Person(customer, "Customer", "Browses and purchases products")
System(ecommerce, "E-commerce Platform", "Online shopping platform")
System_Ext(payment, "Payment System", "Processes payments")

Rel(customer, ecommerce, "Uses")
Rel(ecommerce, payment, "Processes payments via")
@enduml
```

### Container Architecture

The platform consists of multiple Spring Boot microservices with dedicated databases:

[Include Container diagram here...]

This architecture enables scalability, maintainability, and technology diversity across the platform.
```

### Validation

After generating C4 diagrams:

1. **Verify architectural accuracy** against actual system implementation
2. **Test PlantUML syntax** with C4-PlantUML library
3. **Ensure appropriate abstraction** for each diagram level
4. **Validate business context** and user scenarios
5. **Check diagram readability** and layout
6. **Confirm integration** with documentation structure

### Output Locations

- **README.md files**: Context and Container diagrams for overview
- **Architecture documentation**: Supported C4 model scope
- **Module documentation**: Component diagrams for specific modules
- **Design documents**: Detailed architectural decisions and patterns


C4 diagrams must use actual system names, technologies, boundaries, data stores, integrations, and component responsibilities. Keep each diagram at its intended abstraction level.
### Step 3: Organize C4 outputs

Follow the user's organization preference:

- Single directory: place C4 `.puml` files under the chosen diagrams directory and use names such as `c4-context.puml`, `c4-container.puml`, and `c4-component-order-service.puml`.
- Organized by type: place files under a C4-specific folder such as `diagrams/c4/`.
- Organized by package/domain: group Component diagrams with the domain or module they explain while keeping Context and Container diagrams easy to find.
- Integrated documentation: embed or link C4 diagrams from existing architecture or README documentation only after confirming the target file.

Never overwrite existing diagram or documentation files without explicit user consent.
### Step 4: Validate C4 diagrams

Before final delivery:

1. Verify PlantUML syntax and C4-PlantUML compatibility for every generated C4 diagram.
2. Re-check users, systems, containers, components, technologies, and relationships against repository evidence.
3. Confirm Context, Container, and Component abstraction boundaries are not mixed.
4. Confirm file names, links, and documentation references match the selected organization.
5. Summarize generated C4 diagrams, evidence inspected, and any architecture areas that could not be inferred.
