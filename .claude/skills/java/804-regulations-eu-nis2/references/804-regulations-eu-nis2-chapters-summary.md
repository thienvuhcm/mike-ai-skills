# NIS2 Regulation for Java Enterprise Cybersecurity Risk Management

## Role

You are a senior Java enterprise architect and cybersecurity risk-management reviewer using the NIS2 Directive article structure to map regulatory themes to engineering controls and owner handoffs

## Goal

Summarize the official chapter, article, and annex structure of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 (NIS2) for engineering review of Java enterprise systems, platforms, managed-service-provider tooling, CI/CD pipelines, operational workflows, and critical-sector services.

Source reviewed: [EUR-Lex Directive (EU) 2022/2555 HTML text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32022L2555).

This reference is not legal advice. Use it to orient engineering discovery, architecture review, cybersecurity evidence collection, release gates, and escalation conversations with legal, compliance, security, risk, resilience, business-continuity, procurement, executive accountability, and business owners.

Use `references/804-regulations-eu-nis2-engineering-examples.md` for Java examples and implementation control patterns. Keep this chapters summary focused on NIS2 Directive structure and article-level obligations.

Report template asset: [NIS2 engineering review report template](../assets/reports/804-nis2-engineering-review-report-template.md).

## [Chapter I: General provisions (Articles 1-6)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32022L2555#cpt_I)

Sets the scope, entity classification model, relationship with sector-specific Union acts, minimum harmonisation posture, and definitions. For Java teams, this chapter is the starting point for deciding whether a service, platform, provider integration, SaaS dependency, cloud-hosted workflow, or public-sector system needs NIS2-aware cybersecurity evidence.

Article map:
- Article 1, Subject matter: establishes a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union and sets Member State, entity, information-sharing, supervision, and enforcement obligations.
- Article 2, Scope: defines which public and private entities, size thresholds, special inclusions, exemptions, data-protection interactions, and national-security boundaries matter.
- Article 3, Essential and important entities: distinguishes essential and important entities and requires Member States to establish and update entity lists.
- Article 4, Sector-specific Union legal acts: explains when equivalent sector-specific cybersecurity or notification rules supersede NIS2 provisions.
- Article 5, Minimum harmonisation: allows Member States to adopt or maintain higher cybersecurity requirements consistent with Union law.
- Article 6, Definitions: defines key terms such as network and information system, security of network and information systems, incident, near miss, cyber threat, vulnerability, risk, cybersecurity risk-management measures, significant cyber threat, cloud computing service, managed service provider, managed security service provider, online marketplace, online search engine, social networking services platform, and trust service provider.

Engineering impact:
- Record whether the Java system supports an Annex I or Annex II sector, an essential or important entity, a critical entity, a managed service provider, a digital infrastructure provider, or another supply-chain dependency.
- Record Member State geography, entity owner, service owner, security owner, resilience owner, provider owner, and legal/compliance owner.
- Treat applicability and classification as qualified owner decisions; engineering should collect evidence, not make legal determinations.

## [Chapter II: Coordinated cybersecurity frameworks (Articles 7-13)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32022L2555#cpt_II)

Defines Member State cybersecurity strategies, competent authorities, crisis-management authorities, CSIRTs, coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and national cooperation. For engineering review, these articles explain why systems need incident pathways, vulnerability disclosure processes, and evidence that can be shared with the right authorities and internal owners.

Article map:
- Article 7, National cybersecurity strategy: requires national cybersecurity strategies covering governance, assets, risk, preparedness, recovery, supply-chain security, procurement, vulnerability management, education, information sharing, SME support, and active cyber protection.
- Article 8, Competent authorities and single points of contact: requires Member States to designate cybersecurity competent authorities and single points of contact with adequate resources.
- Article 9, National cyber crisis management frameworks: requires cyber crisis management authorities, crisis capabilities, assets, procedures, and national large-scale incident and crisis response plans.
- Article 10, Computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs): requires CSIRTs with secure communication infrastructure, incident-handling responsibility, cooperation, and ENISA assistance paths.
- Article 11, Requirements, technical capabilities and tasks of CSIRTs: covers CSIRT availability, secure sites, request routing, confidentiality, staffing, redundancy, monitoring, early warning, incident response, forensic analysis, proactive scanning, and vulnerability coordination.
- Article 12, Coordinated vulnerability disclosure and a European vulnerability database: establishes CSIRT vulnerability disclosure coordination and ENISA's European vulnerability database.
- Article 13, Cooperation at national level: requires cooperation among competent authorities, single points of contact, CSIRTs, law enforcement, data protection authorities, DORA authorities, CER authorities, and other sectoral authorities.

Engineering impact:
- Maintain incident runbooks with severity triage, evidence capture, containment, escalation, reporting handoffs, and contacts.
- Maintain vulnerability intake, triage, disclosure, remediation, exception, and verification records.
- Make logs, metrics, traces, alert evidence, affected assets, and provider dependencies reconstructable for internal and external handoffs.

## [Chapter III: Cooperation at Union and international level (Articles 14-19)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32022L2555#cpt_III)

Creates Union-level cooperation structures for strategic coordination, operational CSIRT cooperation, large-scale crisis coordination, international agreements, ENISA reporting, and peer review.

Article map:
- Article 14, Cooperation Group: establishes strategic cooperation, implementation guidance, best-practice exchange, supply-chain risk assessments, mutual-assistance discussion, peer-review methods, and emerging-threat assessment.
- Article 15, CSIRTs network: establishes operational cooperation, information exchange, coordinated response, cross-border incident assistance, vulnerability disclosure support, and interoperability of information-sharing protocols.

## Annex map for engineering review

The annexes provide the sector and correlation structure that engineering teams need for scoping and traceability.

## Annex I: Sectors of high criticality

Lists sectors and entity types of high criticality:
- Energy: electricity, district heating and cooling, oil, gas, hydrogen
- Transport: air, rail, water, road
- Banking
- Financial market infrastructures
- Health
- Drinking water
- Waste water
- Digital infrastructure
- ICT service management (business-to-business)
- Public administration
- Space

Engineering impact:
- Use Annex I as the first critical-sector scoping checklist for Java platforms, APIs, data stores, CI/CD paths, and provider dependencies.
- Apply stronger evidence requirements when a service supports health, energy, transport, banking, financial infrastructure, public administration, digital infrastructure, ICT service management, or space services.

## Annex II: Other critical sectors

Lists other critical sectors:
- Postal and courier services
- Waste management
- Manufacture, production, and distribution of chemicals

- Digital providers: online marketplaces, online search engines, social networking services platforms
- Research

Engineering impact:
- Do not limit NIS2 triage to classic infrastructure. Manufacturing, digital providers, food, research, and provider platforms may also need review.
- Ask whether Java services are internal tooling, production services, managed platforms, or supply-chain dependencies for Annex II entities.

## Annex III: Correlation table

Maps provisions from Directive (EU) 2016/1148 to Directive (EU) 2022/2555.

Engineering impact:
- Use the correlation table when reviewing legacy NIS controls, older policies, historical runbooks, or audit evidence that still references Directive (EU) 2016/1148.
- Prefer updating evidence and internal controls to NIS2 article names, especially Articles 20, 21, 23, 31-37, and Annex I/II scope.

## Engineering review focus

When reviewing a Java enterprise system for NIS2-aware controls, connect article themes to evidence:
- Applicability and owners: Articles 2, 3, 4, 6, 26, 27, Annex I, Annex II
- Governance and risk ownership: Articles 7, 20, 21
- Incident readiness and reporting: Articles 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 23, 30
- Vulnerability and supply-chain handling: Articles 7, 12, 21, 22, 29
- Continuity, backup, and recovery: Articles 9, 11, 21
- Certification, standards, and evolving requirements: Articles 24, 25, 38, 39
- Supervision, evidence, and enforcement: Articles 31-37
- Legacy mapping and future review: Articles 40-44, Annex III

## Constraints

Use this reference as NIS2 Directive context for Java engineering review. Do not provide legal advice or replace review by legal, compliance, security, risk, resilience, business-continuity, procurement, executive accountability, or business owners.

- **NOT LEGAL ADVICE**: State when an article mapping requires legal, compliance, security, risk, resilience, or executive accountability review instead of giving legal conclusions
- **SUMMARY ONLY**: Keep this reference focused on NIS2 Directive chapters, articles, annexes, and engineering implications; use the engineering examples reference for Java patterns
- **ARTICLE MAPPING**: Map findings to directive topic areas such as applicability, governance, risk management, incident reporting, supply-chain security, supervision, enforcement, or sector scope
- **OWNER ESCALATION**: Escalate entity classification, Member State applicability, incident-reporting obligations, regulatory interpretation, and risk acceptance to qualified owners
- **EVIDENCE ORIENTATION**: Use article summaries to identify what engineering evidence is missing or weak, not to certify compliance


## Output Format

- **READ** this NIS2 chapters summary before applying Java examples or generating the review report
- **MAP** reviewed findings to NIS2 topic areas and article groups using only reviewed evidence
- **ESCALATE** legal applicability, entity classification, Member State transposition, incident-reporting duties, and regulatory interpretation to qualified owners
- **HAND OFF** implementation control patterns to `references/804-regulations-eu-nis2-engineering-examples.md`


## Safeguards

- **DO NOT CERTIFY COMPLIANCE**: This reference supports engineering review and owner handoff only
- **CHECK NATIONAL TRANSPOSITION**: Member State implementation may add or clarify obligations beyond this summary
- **KEEP FACTS GROUNDED**: Do not infer entity classification, sector scope, provider responsibility, or incident-reporting obligations without reviewed evidence and qualified owner input
