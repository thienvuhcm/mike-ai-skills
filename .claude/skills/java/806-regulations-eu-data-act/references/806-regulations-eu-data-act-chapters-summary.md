# EU Data Act Regulation for Java Enterprise Data Access and Portability Engineering

## Role

You are a senior Java enterprise architect and data-governance engineering reviewer using the EU Data Act article structure to map regulatory themes to engineering controls and owner handoffs

## Goal

Summarize the official chapter and article structure of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (EU Data Act) for engineering review of Java enterprise systems, SaaS platforms, connected-product integrations, APIs, event streams, data spaces, cloud services, operational workflows, and data-sharing processes.

Source reviewed: [EUR-Lex Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 HTML text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32023R2854).

This reference is not legal advice. Use it to orient engineering discovery, architecture review, data-governance evidence collection, release gates, and escalation conversations with legal, compliance, privacy, data governance, security, product, procurement, cloud, risk, business, and provider owners.

Use `references/806-regulations-eu-data-act-engineering-examples.md` for Java examples and implementation control patterns. Keep this chapters summary focused on Data Act structure and article-level engineering implications.

## [Chapter I: General provisions (Articles 1-2)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32023R2854#cpt_I)

Sets the Data Act scope, relationship with personal-data law, data-processing services, non-personal data safeguards, connected-product and related-service concepts, and core definitions. For Java teams, this chapter is the first scoping checkpoint for APIs, Kafka topics, export jobs, metadata catalogs, connected-product integrations, data spaces, smart contracts, and cloud services.

Article map:
- Article 1, Subject matter and scope: covers product data and related service data access, data holder to data recipient sharing, public-sector exceptional-need requests, switching between data processing services, safeguards against unlawful third-country access to non-personal data, and interoperability standards.
- Article 2, Definitions: defines data, metadata, personal data, non-personal data, connected product, related service, data processing service, user, data holder, data recipient, product data, related service data, readily available data, trade secret, customer, switching, exportable data, smart contract, interoperability, open interoperability specification, common specification, and harmonised standard.

Engineering impact:
- Record whether the Java system handles product data, related service data, exportable data, metadata, non-personal data, personal data, mixed datasets, trade secrets, cloud customer data, or data-space data.
- Record possible roles: user, data holder, data recipient, third-party recipient, customer, provider of data processing services, participant in a data space, smart-contract vendor, public-sector requester, and provider owner.
- Treat applicability, data holder status, user entitlement, data recipient role, contract interpretation, cloud-switching obligations, and regulatory interpretation as qualified owner decisions.

## [Chapter II: Business-to-consumer and business-to-business data sharing (Articles 3-7)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32023R2854#cpt_II)

Defines user access to connected-product and related-service data and the right to make data available to third parties. For engineering review, this chapter maps directly to access APIs, machine-readable exports, metadata, authorization, purpose limits, trade-secret controls, user experience, and third-party sharing workflows.

Article map:
- Article 3, Obligation to make product data and related service data accessible to the user: requires access by default, secure access, machine-readable formats, relevant metadata, and pre-contract information about data type, format, volume, retention, access, retrieval, deletion, and sharing.
- Article 4, Rights and obligations of users and data holders: covers user access when data cannot be directly accessed, security-based restrictions, non-neutral interface concerns, request verification minimization, trade-secret protection, refusals or suspensions, personal-data legal-basis handoff, non-personal data use by data holders, and third-party disclosure boundaries.
- Article 5, Right of the user to share data with third parties: covers user-directed third-party access, metadata, secure and machine-readable sharing, gatekeeper restrictions, verification minimization, trade-secret protection, refusals or suspensions, and personal-data rights.

- Article 7, Scope of business-to-consumer and business-to-business data-sharing obligations: sets scope exclusions for certain micro, small, and newly medium-sized enterprises and invalidates contract terms that undermine Chapter II rights.

Engineering impact:
- Design data access endpoints, export jobs, and event-sharing workflows with entitlement checks, purpose recording, recipient identity, format guarantees, metadata, quality-of-service evidence, and audit trails.
- Avoid collecting request verification data beyond what is necessary; do not keep access logs longer than required for request execution, infrastructure security, and maintenance.
- Identify trade secrets and sensitive commercial data in metadata and route confidentiality measures, refusals, suspensions, or exceptions to qualified legal, data-governance, security, and product owners.
- Coordinate with GDPR controls whenever personal data or mixed datasets are involved.

## [Chapter III: Obligations for data holders obliged to make data available pursuant to Union law (Articles 8-12)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32023R2854#cpt_III)

Defines fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory, transparent data-sharing arrangements, compensation, dispute settlement, technical protection measures, and scope.
