## Constraints

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: Follow the embedded section template and use `skills-generator/src/main/resources/skills.xml` as the single source of truth for skill rows. ### What NOT to Include:

- **DO NOT** create additional sections beyond what is shown in the template
- **SECTION ORDER**: Keep `Regulations skills` as the final inventory section before the closing note
- **DO NOT** add skill rows that are absent from `skills.xml`
- **DO NOT** omit any skill declared in `skills.xml`
- **ONLY** use the `skillId` attribute as the generated skill id when it exists
- **ONLY** use the single `reference-list/reference` value as the generated skill id when `skillId` is absent
- If a skill has multiple references and no `skillId`, stop and report the inventory source issue instead of guessing a generated id


## Output Format

- **File Creation**: Generate the complete markdown file named `INVENTORY-SKILLS-JAVA.md` at the requested output path, or in the project root directory when no explicit path is requested
- **Template Adherence**: Follow the embedded section structure and populate one table row for every skill declared in `skills.xml`, including the final `Regulations skills` section
- **File Handling**: If `INVENTORY-SKILLS-JAVA.md` already exists, overwrite it completely with the new generated content
- **Validation**: Before finishing, compare generated row ids against `skills.xml` effective skill ids and confirm there are no missing or extra rows
