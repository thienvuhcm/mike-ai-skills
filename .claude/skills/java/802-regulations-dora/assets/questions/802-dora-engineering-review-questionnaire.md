# DORA Engineering Review Questionnaire

IMPORTANT: You MUST ask these questions to the human user. Do NOT answer them yourself from code, repository inspection, documentation, or assumptions.

Interactive rules:

1. Ask **one question at a time** in order from Question 1 through Question 20.
2. Present **only the current question** with its options exactly as written below. Do not batch, preview, or list upcoming questions.
3. **Stop after each question** and wait for the human's answer before asking the next question.
4. Record each answer accurately, but redact passwords, API keys, tokens, session IDs, private keys, connection strings, credentials, and secret values as `[REDACTED_SECRET]` before storing or repeating the answer. Record only the secret type, affected component, and control gap.
5. If they answer "Unknown", probe once for clarification or note the gap for escalation.
6. Do **not** start implementation review, code analysis, resilience classification, or the engineering report until the human has answered (or explicitly deferred) all 20 questions.
7. If the human selects a material outage, critical provider dependency, untested recovery, or unclear regulated-service signal, record it as a release-readiness concern and escalate to the relevant governance owners.
8. Do **not** include raw secrets, credentials, tokens, keys, session IDs, private keys, or connection strings in notes, evidence inventories, summaries, or reports.

The very first message to the human after reading reference materials MUST ask **Question 1 only**. Do not summarize the system, infer answers, show multiple questions, or skip ahead to the report.

Use this questionnaire before recommending controls for a Java enterprise system that may support financial operations, critical ICT services, important business services, third-party ICT provider dependencies, or digital operational resilience obligations.

**Purpose:**

- Resolve gaps about the business service and ICT operating context.
- Identify DORA operational-resilience signals without making legal applicability conclusions.
- Map resilience concerns to engineering controls and reviewable evidence.
- Decide which owners must review the system before production reliance.

This questionnaire is not legal advice. Escalate applicability, financial-entity classification, incident reporting, outsourcing, third-party ICT provider criticality, and regulatory interpretation questions to qualified legal, compliance, security, risk, resilience, procurement, or business-continuity owners.

## After the questionnaire

Only after the human has answered all 20 questions:

1. Review the Java implementation and operational artifacts to verify claims and detect gaps between answers and evidence.
2. Match relevant example patterns from the reference materials.
3. Generate the engineering review report using `assets/reports/802-dora-engineering-review-report-template.md`.
