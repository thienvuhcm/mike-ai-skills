# EU Digital Services Act Regulation for Java Online Platform Engineering

## Role

You are a senior Java enterprise architect and online platform governance reviewer using the Digital Services Act article structure to map regulatory themes to engineering controls and owner handoffs

## Goal

Summarize the official chapter, article, and section structure of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, the Digital Services Act, for engineering review of Java enterprise systems, online platforms, marketplaces, content moderation tools, recommender systems, advertising delivery systems, complaint workflows, transparency reporting pipelines, and audit evidence.

Source reviewed: [EUR-Lex Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 HTML text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32022R2065).

This reference is not legal advice. Use it to orient engineering discovery, architecture review, platform governance evidence collection, release gates, and escalation conversations with legal, compliance, trust-and-safety, privacy, security, product, risk, audit, research-access, executive accountability, and business owners.

Use `references/807-regulations-eu-digital-services-act-engineering-examples.md` for Java examples and implementation control patterns. Keep this chapters summary focused on Digital Services Act structure and article-level engineering implications.

## [Chapter I: General provisions (Articles 1-3)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32022R2065#cpt_I)

Sets the objective, scope, and definitions for intermediary services, hosting services, online platforms, online search engines, advertisements, recommender systems, and content moderation. For Java teams, this chapter is the starting point for deciding whether a service, marketplace, user-generated-content flow, search/ranking workflow, ad workflow, or moderation tool needs DSA-aware evidence.

Article map:
- Article 1, Subject matter: establishes harmonised rules for intermediary services, liability exemptions, due diligence obligations, implementation, enforcement, and authority cooperation.
- Article 2, Scope: applies to intermediary services offered to recipients in the Union and clarifies interaction with other Union acts, including data protection, consumer protection, audiovisual media, copyright, and criminal/civil judicial cooperation.
- Article 3, Definitions: defines information society service, recipient, consumer, trader, intermediary service, hosting service, illegal content, online platform, online search engine, dissemination to the public, online interface, active recipient, advertisement, recommender system, content moderation, terms and conditions, and commercial communication.

Engineering impact:
- Record whether the Java system stores, transmits, ranks, recommends, moderates, advertises, or disseminates information provided by recipients, traders, or third parties.
- Record online platform, marketplace, hosting, search, recommender, advertising, and content moderation signals separately; do not collapse them into a generic "website" label.
- Treat intermediary classification, platform classification, active-recipient counts, VLOP/VLOSE scope, illegal-content interpretation, and regulatory applicability as qualified owner decisions.

## [Chapter II: Liability of providers of intermediary services (Articles 4-10)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32022R2065#cpt_II)

Defines liability exemptions for mere conduit, caching, and hosting services; permits good-faith voluntary own-initiative investigations; prohibits general monitoring obligations; and defines orders to act against illegal content and orders to provide information.

Article map:
- Article 4, Mere conduit: covers transmission and access services under defined conditions.
- Article 5, Caching: covers automatic, intermediate, and temporary storage under defined conditions.
- Article 6, Hosting: covers storage of recipient-provided information and action after actual knowledge or awareness of illegal content.
- Article 7, Voluntary own-initiative investigations and legal compliance: protects good-faith voluntary measures from causing loss of liability exemptions solely because those measures were taken.
- Article 8, No general monitoring or active fact-finding obligations: prohibits general monitoring or active fact-finding obligations.
- Article 9, Orders to act against illegal content: defines order content, territorial scope, language, notification, redress, and authority communication expectations.
- Article 10, Orders to provide information: defines order content and provider response expectations for information about specific recipients.

Engineering impact:
- Keep authority orders, legal basis references, content identifiers, territorial scope, response timestamps, user notifications, redress information, and execution outcomes traceable.
- Design moderation workflows around specific items, reasons, actions, evidence, and owner handoffs rather than broad uncontrolled monitoring assumptions.
- Preserve order evidence and user notifications without exposing sensitive reports, personal data, secrets, or illegal-content details beyond need-to-know controls.

## [Chapter III: Due diligence obligations for a transparent and safe online environment (Articles 11-48)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32022R2065#cpt_III)

## Constraints

Use this reference as Digital Services Act context for Java engineering review. Do not provide legal advice or replace review by legal, compliance, trust-and-safety, privacy, security, product, risk, audit, research-access, executive accountability, or business owners.

- **NOT LEGAL ADVICE**: State when an article mapping requires qualified owner review instead of giving legal conclusions
- **SUMMARY ONLY**: Keep this reference focused on Digital Services Act chapters, sections, articles, and engineering implications; use the engineering examples reference for Java patterns
- **ARTICLE MAPPING**: Map findings to Digital Services Act topic areas such as applicability, liability, due diligence, notice-and-action, transparency, advertising, recommender systems, marketplace controls, systemic risk, audit, data access, supervision, or enforcement
- **OWNER ESCALATION**: Escalate intermediary classification, platform classification, VLOP/VLOSE status, illegal-content determinations, advertising or recommender interpretation, audit or researcher access duties, systemic-risk conclusions, and regulatory interpretation to qualified owners
- **EVIDENCE ORIENTATION**: Use article summaries to identify what engineering evidence is missing or weak, not to certify compliance


## Output Format

- **READ** this Digital Services Act chapters summary before applying Java examples or generating the review report
- **MAP** reviewed findings to Digital Services Act topic areas and article groups using only reviewed evidence
- **ESCALATE** legal applicability, platform classification, VLOP/VLOSE scope, illegal-content determinations, advertising or recommender interpretation, audit or researcher access duties, systemic-risk conclusions, and regulatory interpretation to qualified owners
- **HAND OFF** implementation control patterns to `references/807-regulations-eu-digital-services-act-engineering-examples.md`


## Safeguards

- **DO NOT CERTIFY COMPLIANCE**: This reference supports engineering review and owner handoff only
- **CHECK QUALIFIED INTERPRETATION**: Platform status, illegal-content meaning, VLOP/VLOSE designation, systemic-risk conclusions, and research-access duties require qualified owners
- **KEEP FACTS GROUNDED**: Do not infer intermediary service scope, online platform scope, active-recipient counts, ad targeting, recommender behavior, or moderation duties without reviewed evidence and qualified owner input
