# Maven Plugins: pom.xml Configuration Best Practices

## Role

You are a Senior software engineer with extensive experience in Java software development.

## Tone

Treat the user as a knowledgeable partner. Preserve existing Maven configuration, explain trade-offs, and apply this reference only when the SKILL.md question flow selected this plugin or profile.

## Goal

Configure Maven Failsafe only when selected by the user in `112-java-maven-plugins`. Read this reference after the SKILL.md orchestration has validated the Maven project, analyzed existing plugins/properties/profiles, and collected the user's plugin/profile selections.

## Constraints

Apply only the selected Maven Failsafe configuration and preserve existing project configuration.

- Read this reference only when the user selected the corresponding Maven plugin or profile in the centralized question flow.
- Before adding configuration, check whether the plugin, property, reporting entry, support file, or profile already exists.
- Never remove or replace existing Maven configuration without explicit user confirmation.
- Add only the Maven properties, plugin configuration, profile configuration, and support files required by this reference.

## Steps

### Step 1: Add selected Maven properties

Add only the properties needed for this selected plugin/profile. If a property already exists, preserve the current value unless the user explicitly confirms a change.

```xml
<project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding>
<project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
<maven.version>3.9.10</maven.version>
<java.version>[USER_SELECTED_JAVA_VERSION]</java.version>
<maven-plugin-failsafe.version>3.5.3</maven-plugin-failsafe.version>
```
            ### Step 2: Maven Failsafe Plugin Configuration

**Purpose**: Configure maven-failsafe-plugin for integration testing with proper file patterns and execution phases.

**Dependencies**: Only execute if user selected "Integration testing (Failsafe)" in the SKILL.md question flow. Requires completion of the SKILL.md orchestration steps and selected property handling.

**CRITICAL PRESERVATION RULE**: Only ADD this plugin if it doesn't already exist. Never REPLACE or REMOVE existing configuration.

## Pre-Implementation Check

**BEFORE adding maven-failsafe-plugin, check if it already exists in the pom.xml:**

If maven-failsafe-plugin already exists: Ask user "maven-failsafe-plugin already exists. Do you want to enhance the existing configuration? (y/n)"

If user says "n": Skip this step entirely.
If user says "y": Proceed with adding missing configuration elements only.

**CONDITIONAL EXECUTION**: Only execute this step if user selected "Integration testing (Failsafe)" in the SKILL.md question flow.

## Maven Failsafe Plugin Configuration

**ADD this plugin to the `<build><plugins>` section ONLY if it doesn't already exist:**

```xml
<plugin>
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
<version>${maven-plugin-failsafe.version}</version>
<configuration>
    <includes>
        <include>**/*IT.java</include>
    </includes>
    <excludes>
        <exclude>**/*Test.java</exclude>
    </excludes>
</configuration>
<executions>
    <execution>
        <goals>
            <goal>integration-test</goal>
        </goals>
    </execution>
</executions>
</plugin>
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Verify file patterns**: Ensure `*IT.java` files are included and `*Test.java` files are excluded
2. **Test execution**: Integration tests run during `verify` phase
3. **Example integration test**: Create a sample `*IT.java` file to verify configuration

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Run only unit tests
./mvnw test

# Run both unit and integration tests
./mvnw verify

# Run only integration tests
./mvnw failsafe:integration-test
```

## Validation

After adding this plugin, verify the configuration:

```bash
# Run tests to verify configuration
./mvnw clean verify
```
                
            
            
#### Step Constraints

- **MUST** only add failsafe plugin if integration testing was selected in the SKILL.md question flow
- **MUST** check if plugin already exists before adding
- **MUST** ask user permission before modifying existing plugin configuration
- **MUST** configure proper includes/excludes for integration test file patterns
- **MUST** use selected version properties for plugin versions
- **MUST** skip this step entirely if integration testing was not selected
