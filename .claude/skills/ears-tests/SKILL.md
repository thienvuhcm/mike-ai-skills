description: Generate parameterized (table-driven) tests from EARS requirement statements — the deterministic transform that turns an SBCE capability spec's `## Requirements` into one parameterized test per requirement group and one labeled row per statement id. Stack-neutral; owns only the EARS→table mapping and the spec↔test trace, and delegates the test syntax to the composed stack skill (JUnit 5, zunit, Playwright). Use whenever turning EARS requirements, acceptance criteria, or an SBCE/`/sbce` spec into tests; whenever you see "When/While/If…then, the … shall …" statements that need covering; or when asked for table-driven, data-driven, or parameterized tests from a requirement group. Triggers on "EARS", "parameterized tests", "table-driven tests", "data-driven tests", "tests from requirements", "tests from the spec", "cover requirement Rn", "generate tests for this capability", "acceptance criteria to tests".

Turn EARS requirement statements into parameterized tests. The leverage is structural: every
EARS pattern is a `(condition → response)` tuple, and an SBCE requirement **group** already
collects statements that share **one boundary operation** — same arrange/act skeleton, only the
data differs. That is the textbook precondition for parameterization, so the mapping is mechanical.

Own only the **transform and the trace**. The concrete test syntax is the composed stack skill's
call — never name a runner or framework verb here. When the generated tests exercise the running
system, the system-tests skill owns the contract (black box, coordinates as configuration, total
verdict reporting).

## The mapping

- One requirement **group `Rn` → one parameterized test method** (the shared boundary op is the body).
- One **statement `Rn.m` → one row** in the parameter source.
- The **statement id `Rn.m` is the row's display name** — so the spec↔test binding stays per-statement
  and grep-visible, exactly as SBCE requires (a removed id retires its row; a row with no statement is drift).
- The id MUST surface in the **runner-visible case label** — as a string literal or as a symbol whose
  display form is the literal id. An id that appears only in a comment is not a trace.
- The EARS pattern fixes the row's **role and shape** — you do not invent the columns, you read them off the pattern.

## EARS pattern → row shape

The system is always **the BC**. Each pattern decomposes into the arrange/act/assert columns of a row:

| Pattern | Statement shape | Arrange (state) | Act (trigger) | Assert (response) | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Event-driven | `When <trigger>, the BC shall <response>` | — | trigger | response | happy |
| Unwanted-behaviour | `If <trigger>, then the BC shall <response>` | — | bad/invalid trigger | rejection / error | unhappy |
| State-driven | `While <precondition>, the BC shall <response>` | precondition | (implicit) | response | stateful |
| Complex | `While <precondition>, when <trigger>, the BC shall <response>` | precondition | trigger | response | full tuple |
| Optional-feature | `Where <feature>, the BC shall <response>` | feature enabled | trigger | response | gated |
| Ubiquitous | `The BC shall <response>` | — | — | invariant | single case (least parameterizable — a plain test is fine) |

Mixing a happy `When` row and an unhappy `If…then` row in the same group's table is the norm — it is
how one parameterized method covers both the success and the rejection path of one boundary op.

## Deterministic vs. authored

EARS hands you the *enumeration*, not the *data*. Keep the two honestly separated so the generated
test never silently asserts an assumption:

- **Deterministic (generate without judgment):** the method-per-group, the row-per-statement, the
  `Rn.m` row labels (in Java, the generated per-BC trace symbols), which boundary op the body calls,
  the row role from the pattern, and the bijection check (every `Rn.m` ↔ exactly one row).
- **Authored (leave a clearly marked stub for human/LLM):** the concrete input fixture and the
  assertion that expresses `<response>`. EARS abstracts the response in prose ("create and confirm
  an order") and carries no values — do not fabricate them. Emit a failing/`TODO` stub a human or a
  later `/sbce apply` pass fills, so an unwritten assertion shows up red, not green.

## Realization is the stack skill's call

This skill is stack-neutral. The parameter-source mechanism and display-name form belong to the
composed stack skill — read `references/realizations.md` for the per-stack shape (JUnit 5
`@ParameterizedTest` + `@MethodSource`, zunit's table form, Playwright `test.describe` per group).
Java stacks materialize the `Rn.m` ids as a generated per-BC `Requirement` annotation with a nested
`Rn` enum — the label contract is unchanged because the enum's display form is the literal id; web
stacks and the black-box `-st` module keep literal strings. Pick the one the project already uses;
never introduce a second test idiom.

## Composition

- **`/sbce`** owns the spec and the stable `Rn.m` ids — this skill consumes them; it never edits the
  spec or coins ids. During `/sbce apply`, this is how the *spec→code* "a traceable test per `Rn.m`"
  step is realized when a group has ≥2 statements.
- **`/bce`** owns where tests and the BC live; the **stack skill** owns the test syntax and the
  "are you green?" oracle.
- Prefer a parameterized method only when a group has **≥2 statements**; a lone statement is a plain
  test — do not force a one-row table.
