# Capability spec template

The spec **is** the BC's package doc — there is no separate `specs/` tree. Author the Markdown
below into the BC's package doc; one doc describes exactly one BC, and a single feature may
decompose into several BCs — one doc each.

- **Java**: `src/main/java/<base>/<bc-name>/package-info.java` — each line prefixed `///` ([JEP 467](https://openjdk.org/jeps/467) Markdown doc comments), ending with the `package …;` declaration.
- **web**: `app/src/<bc-name>/package-info.md` — plain Markdown.

The **BC name** is the only identity — a single lowercase token, derived from the package (Java)
or folder (web) the doc lives in. The stack skill owns the location (package base / source root).

Rules for filling it in:

- Stack-neutral. No transport, no types, no framework verbs, no *how* — only what the boundary promises.
- No frontmatter — the BC name comes from the location.
- Boundary operations are verb-noun and transport-neutral (`place-order`, not `POST /orders`).
- Every boundary op traces to a requirement group (`Rn`); every requirement is ≥1 EARS statement, and **each statement carries a stable id `Rn.m`** that ≥1 test embeds in its trace — so the spec↔test binding is per-statement and bijective. Ids are stable: never renumber on reorder; a removed statement's id is retired, not reused.
- **Optional `why`.** A statement (or boundary op) may end with a terse `_(why: …)_` — the rule's *origin/intent*. Rationale, not contract: non-verified, **not a trace target** (the statement still needs its test), and bound to the id (retires with the statement; the `Rn.m` prefix stays first). Capture *why the rule exists*, never *how it currently works*.
- **Optional `## Decisions`.** A BC-local confirmed choice may be logged before `## Out of scope`, under the same rules as the system doc's `## Decisions`: stable `Dn`, rejected alternatives in a trailing `_(why: …; rejected: …)_`, append-only (supersede, never edit), rationale not contract — no test, not a trace target.
- **Optional `## References`.** External specifications the BC implements or conforms to — an RFC, a Jakarta/MicroProfile spec chapter, a standard, a regulation, a product document — one bullet per link with what it governs here, optionally scoped to ids (`governs R2`). Rationale, not contract: no id, no test, not a trace target. A reference informs requirements; the behaviour itself is still an EARS `Rn.m` with a test. Prefer stable, versioned URLs.
- Keep it minimal — an empty `## Out of scope` is fine, but the heading stays to keep the boundary sharp.

Requirements are written in [EARS](https://alistairmavin.com/ears/) — each statement fits one
of the six patterns tabled in SKILL.md's "Spec format rules", and the system is always **the
BC**. Reach for the unwanted-behaviour (`If…then`) and state-driven (`While…`) patterns to
capture the error and edge cases that otherwise go unwritten and untested.

The Markdown body (this is the whole spec):

```markdown
# <Bc Name>
> One sentence: this BC's single responsibility.

## Boundary
<!-- the single external entry point — operations as verb-noun, transport-neutral -->
- `place-order` — submit a cart for fulfilment
- `cancel-order` — withdraw an unfulfilled order

## Requirements
<!-- EARS statements (the system is the BC); group related ones under a titled Rn; give each statement a stable id Rn.m; every boundary op traces to a group; every statement id traces to >=1 test that embeds it -->
### R1: Place an order
- R1.1 — When a cart with at least one item is submitted, the BC shall create and confirm an order.
- R1.2 — If the cart is empty, then the BC shall reject the request. _(why: empty carts were the top source of phantom orders)_

### R2: Cancel an order
- R2.1 — While an order is unfulfilled, the BC shall allow it to be cancelled.
- R2.2 — If the order is already fulfilled, then the BC shall reject the cancellation.

## Entities
<!-- optional — stateful domain nouns this BC owns; names only, no fields, no types; omit the whole section if none -->
- Order, Cart

## References
<!-- optional — external specs this BC implements or conforms to; one link per bullet with what it governs here; rationale, not contract: no id, no test; omit the whole section if none -->
- [RFC 9457 — Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457) — shape of every rejection (governs R1.2, R2.2)

## Out of scope
<!-- what this BC deliberately does not do; keep the heading even when empty, to keep the boundary sharp -->
```

In **Java**, prefix every line with `///` and end the file with the package declaration:

```java
/// # Checkout
/// > Accept a cart and turn it into a confirmed, cancellable order.
///
/// ## Boundary
/// - `place-order` — submit a cart for fulfilment
/// …
package <base>.checkout;
```

In **web**, the same Markdown body is the entire `package-info.md` — no `///`, no `package` line.
